# GestioneBilancio with Database
Upgrade of the old project GestioneBilancio.
In this new project i implemented a database in PostgreSQL to keep track of the items in the Balance sheet table. 
Remember to change the settings for your database in the file model/Postgres.java.
You can compile and run using the directory compile_only_jar, in the file create_jar.txt there is the command to create your .jar file with my project directory tree 
and then you can use compile_jar.sh to run the program.
